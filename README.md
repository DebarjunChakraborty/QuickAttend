## Overview

In the modern academic landscape, timely and accurate attendance tracking is vital. QuickAttend replaces manual sign-ins with QR codes, offering a fast, secure, and paperless solution. Administrators can generate unique codes for each student and session, while students simply scan to record their presence. Real-time data is stored centrally, enabling efficient reporting and analysis.

## Features

- **Automated Attendance**: Instant marking via QR code scanning.
- **User Roles**: Separate panels for administrators and students.
- **Real-Time Reporting**: Immediate access to attendance data.
- **Attendance History**: Students view their own records at any time.
- **Defaulter List**: Automatic generation of a list of students with low attendance.
- **Secure Access**: User authentication for all panels.
- **Scalable Design**: Suitable for small classrooms up to large institutions.

## SDG Alignment
